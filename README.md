# Math club

The current aim of the math club is to discuss the paper by Kryazhimskiy and
Plotkin (2008): **The Population Genetics of dN/dS** (available
[here][Kryazhimskiy2008]). This paper addresses the validity of studying
evolutionary pressures on protein coding sequences by calculating the dN/dS
ratio for polymorphisms observed in a single species, since this ratio was
initially developed for the comparison of sequences across different species.

The paper is challenging from a theoretical point of view, since we do not have
the background needed to fully apprehend its content. After discussing
together, we agreed that it would make sense to try to obtain a good
understanding of the foundations first before we try to go further. A proposed
schedule is:

  1.  the Wright-Fisher model (neutral, with and without mutation or selection)
  2.  the dN/dS model for comparison of sequences between populations
  3.  a bit of coalescent theory?
  4.  deriving step by step the formulas in the paper



## First meeting

The first meeting should take place around 15-16th of May. The theme will be
the Wright-Fisher model. Roland agreed to make a (short?) presentation
concerning the model. The aim is that we are all able to derive the model from
the initial steps in order to understand it and to be able to modify it to our
needs. Once we are all at the same point for the theory, we can play around with it
using R.

For the very first meeting, the goal is to understand the neutral Wright-Fisher
model. This is the simplest form of the model, and once we are comfortable with
it we can then study how selection and mutation can be introduced in it.

It would be nice if everybody could have a pen and paper for the theoretical
part, and a laptop (or one laptop by pairs of people) for the playing with R
part. We could use [Etherpad][EtherpadWebsite] to share code between us.



## Reference material

The pdf of Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin can be accessed from the [PLoS
Genetics][Kryazhimskiy2008] website.

A great resource is the book [Theoretical Evolutionary Genetics][FelsensteinTEG] by
Joseph Felsenstein. The book is unfinished but the draft is available for
download.
